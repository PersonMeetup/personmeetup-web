My blog is a space that lets me explore a variety of topics, whether it be [how I utilize technology](/blog/technology/) or [how I understand myself and the world around me](/blog/perspective/). It's still a space I need to grow and develop, but there are already a few pieces within it that really stick to mind.

- [“How Does One Write”](/blog/how-does-one-write) is worth mentioning right from the start, as it summarizes the mental burdens that often keep me from writing more.
- [“Computation Induced Exhaustion”](/blog/electrical-demands-of-computers) is an extended version of an essay I had written for an Earth Day zine back in 2022, covering material that I either had to cut out or learned of after publishing.
