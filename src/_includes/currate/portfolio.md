While I'm happy with many of the projects I've worked on in the past, the ones I'm truly proud of are the ones I'm working on currently. One of those projects is [_Catalyst_](https://www.moddb.com/mods/portal-catalyst), a mod for _Portal 2_ that takes players through the visual transition between the two games. The second project is [_COVALRIA_](https://covalria.com), a fantasy, slice of life webcomic that's still in active development.

Beyond my upcoming work, there are quite a few released projects I'm still proud of:

- [“Detour”](/portfolio/detour) was the first custom map I worked on in _Portal 2_, where I experimented with custom elements and visual styles.
- In terms of scope, [“Farlands”](/portfolio/farlands) has remained as one of my biggest maps to date with its environments.
- [“Rations”](/portfolio/rations) was a university project that taken on a life of its own, as I'm planning on expanding upon it in the future.
- [“Sn0wy Direct”](/portfolio/sn0wy-direct) was my first major video editing project in a long time, and its original soundtrack was just as fun to make.
