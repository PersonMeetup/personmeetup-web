As of right now, much of my focus within game design has pertained to building levels. I got my start through _Portal 2's_ in-game level editor, whose hidden ability to export to Source's Hammer Editor ended up being my gateway into level design. Since then, I've made several maps for both _Portal 2_ and _Team Fortress 2_, and I'm currently a level designer and secondary writer for [Catalyst](https://www.moddb.com/mods/portal-catalyst).

Of course, I still want to explore the broader aspects of game design. I'm currently learning how to use PICO-8 to further my understanding in the field, to which I've already seen some success in local game jams.
