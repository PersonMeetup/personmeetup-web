As of right now, much of my focus within game design has pertained to building levels. I got my start through Portal 2's in-game level editor, whose hidden ability to export to the Source engine's Hammer Level Editor ended up being my gateway into level design. I'm currently learning how to use PICO-8 to further my understanding in the field, although I have already seen some success in local game jams.
