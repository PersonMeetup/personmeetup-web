Growing up, I had a passion for making my own videos. What started as a kid waving their camcorder around the house would later become hours spent editing screen recordings they took while playing online games with friends. I learned a lot about video editing during my youth, constantly experimenting and trying different things with my edits. Although I don't make videos as often as I used to, it's still an interest of mine that I wish to do more of in the future.
