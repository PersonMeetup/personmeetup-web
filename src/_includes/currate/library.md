I like to bookmark many of the pages I find across the internet. I find it lets me create my own personal search engine on pages that I've already visited, allowing me to skip hunting for them all over again. With that said, there are plenty of pages I've bookmarked that I've never gone back to look at. This leaves much of what I find neglected, gathering digital dust.

My purpose with this library then is to share the various pages I come across on the internet, rather than hording their URLs to myself. I owe a special thanks to [Nicolas Hoizey](https://nicolas-hoizey.com/) for his [bookmarklet](https://nicolas-hoizey.com/articles/2023/02/08/a-bookmarklet-to-create-a-new-link-content-markdown-on-github/) that creates a new link page within a GitHub repository, as it has made this page a maintainable idea.
