My biggest interest with music production comes from what I can do with limitations. Much of the software and samples I use within my tracks are open source or freebies; the few instruments I've actually purchased have distinctive sounds that I could immediately imagine their potential uses. Despite my limited arsenal, I'm still capable of producing music utilizing both orchestral and electronic instruments.
