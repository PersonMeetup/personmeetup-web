I dabble in _a lot_ of different fields, ranging from computer science to the performing arts. This means that many of my interests can't be lumped into any one of the previous categories; hence the name “overflow”. With that said, here are some of the other things that I do:

- I program from time to time, making much of my code available on [GitHub](https://github.com/PersonMeetup).
- I grew up playing Team Fortress 2 to the extent that [I have a few competitive seasons under my belt](/portfolio/competitive/).
