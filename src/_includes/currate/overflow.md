I dabble in _a lot_ of different fields, ranging from computer science to the performing arts. This means that many of my interests can't be lumped into any one of the previous categories; hence the name “overflow”. With that said, here are some of the other things that I do:

- I program from time to time, making much of my code available on [GitHub](https://github.com/PersonMeetup).
- I grew up playing Team Fortress 2, getting involved in the game's community run competitive scene early on. Several years later, [I have a few competitive seasons under my belt](/portfolio/competitive/).
- I'm currently helping write [_COVALRIA_](https://covalria.com), a webcomic being made by my friends [Cocodotts](https://twitter.com/cocodotts), [Kalmia](https://twitter.com/kvlmiv) and I.
