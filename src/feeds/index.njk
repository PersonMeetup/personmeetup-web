<h1>Feeds</h1>
<article>
	<p>Interested in knowing whenever I release something new? Consider bookmarking one of my Web Feeds! They're a great way to get caught up on what I do without having to subscribe to a newsletter. </p>

		<p>Web Feeds are an XML document that allows users to follow updates on content they consume on the web. While they can be consumed as a web page just fine, they can also be used with a "newsreader" app to aggregate content from multiple sources at once. <a href="https://aboutfeeds.com/">About Feeds</a> contains more information about how they work if you're interested.</p>
		<p>Each feed is also availible in the <a href="https://www.jsonfeed.org/">JSON Feed</a> format, which function similarly to their XML counterparts. The primary difference is the data format, which can be more easily utilized by developers.</p>
		<!--This is further text that elaborates on web feeds. It provides optional material on their usage with readers and their JSON varieties.-->
