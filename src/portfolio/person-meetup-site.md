I initially wasn't sure about developing my own website. Despite having previously learned about web development both on my own and in university as well as discovering [Neocities](https://neocities.org), it was something that I kept putting off for later. That is, until I saw [NetworkChuck's video on making a website](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwUz3E9AW0w). While the rest of the video wasn't applicable to me, I found myself paying attention to the big 3 reasons Chuck gave for making a website; Standing out, making a difference, and creating opportunities.

While I had the confidence push I needed to set out making this site, I was still in university. That meant this idea would have to be set on the back-burner until I had a free moment. I ended up getting that sooner than expected, however, as my university would face a month long strike that started mid February. As soon as my final class finished, I dove head first into getting this site built using the limited knowledge of [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev) I had at the time.

This website is still an ongoing project for me as I continue to expand, develop, and write content for it. Below are some articles I've written about the various things I learned during this process.
