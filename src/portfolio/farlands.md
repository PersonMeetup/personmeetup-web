_Farlands_ was developed for [Thinking With Portals](https://www.thinking.withportals.com/)'s third mapping competition and was one of my most popular _Portal 2_ maps, which probably could be explained because of it's inclusion of Wheatley. It still remains as one of my most ambitious maps due to it's scale and scope alone. It was a challenging map to deliver with me unable to compile it at the very end, all the while feeling a time crunch with a deadline fast approaching.
