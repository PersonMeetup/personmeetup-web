*Overflowing Canvas* was a track inspired by the sneak peak for [ULTRAKILL's](http://devilmayquake.com) first level in layer 7 (Violence) titled the ["Garden of Forking Paths"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8z3sVyohlA). While the [WIP music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kt6gc3XMC9E) is likely more fitting to the intended atmosphere of the level, I couldn't help but feel it needed to be more agressive. 

Also worth mentioning I did the cover art myself! Since ULTRAKILL's soundtrack uses two tone silloetes for its cover art, I figured I'd try my hand at a similar approach. I dabbled in a tri-tone to give some perspective and depth on the Mannequin, whose pose is referenced from the final boss of *Drakengard's* ending E. Given it's the first real digital artwork I've done, I'm really proud of how it came out!
