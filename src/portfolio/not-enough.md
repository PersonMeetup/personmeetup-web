> “Rest brother… Not enough left of me… to save a second time…”

Around the start of the year, my friend Pyro sent me a comic based on [Brother Ignis'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dab15GwzR04), a character from the Blood Angels Space Marine chapter in *Warhammer 40,000*. Since I had been dabbling with voice work around that time, the idea of dubbing the comic came to mind. While it would be a couple of months before I got around to doing this, it was a fun exercise in editing, sound design, and vocal work!
