_Grass is Greener Today_ was one of the tracks I created when I was first playing around with Digital Audio Workstations. I think the first half was initially made to play around with Spitfire Audio's [_BBC Symphony Orchestra Discover_](https://www.spitfireaudio.com/shop/a-z/bbc-symphony-orchestra-discover/) Plugin, with the second half being me wanting to incorporate synths into the track. I ended up releasing it when I rediscovered the track's project file on my hard drive since it was decent.
