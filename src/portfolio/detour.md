This is just some temp text for testing out layouts and templates. This text is spesifically for an idea I had that involves saving projects as markdown documents rather than as one big JSON document. Information of each project would be separated meaning creating a "postmortem" for each project is simplified, and editing data would still be possible with the use of YAML.
