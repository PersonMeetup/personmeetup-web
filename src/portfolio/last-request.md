My friends pulled up a [WWE clip of Paul Bearer asking Kane to take out The Undertaker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJKwZqOQaYI), specifically for the WOAH at the very end from the commentators. For some reason, Paul's speech appealed to me enough that I decided to make something to use that one voice clip in.
