When _Half-Life: Alyx_ got announced, I noticed that the Steam Discussions were all focused on the fact that it was a Half-Life game in VR. Seeing the heat in some discussions, I took to making my own thread with the following question:

> Forget Half Life, what do you guys think of VR? Is it the next step forward? Something that merges two realities that should be far apart? Simply too expensive for you?

I got a lot of insight from that thread, which pushed me to compile all those view points into a video that would be found easier than a Steam Discussions thread.
