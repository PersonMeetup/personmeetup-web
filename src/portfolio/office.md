Roy Berardo held a Home Depot themed mapping competition, where our submissions had to be based around doors and windows. Despite coming hot off the heels of barely surviving another competition, I decided to make something for this one as well. It didn't win the contest, but it achieved it's intended goal. Just look at these raving reviews!
