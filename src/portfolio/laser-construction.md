> Just because it's under construction, doesn't mean we can't make science!

_Laser Construction_ was the first custom map I released that was made in Valve's Hammer Editor for _Portal 2_. I had spent the past few months working with the editor, trying to make [another map](/portfolio/detour), when [Thinking With Portals](https://www.thinking.withportals.com/)'s Discord held their first contest. This was my submission.
