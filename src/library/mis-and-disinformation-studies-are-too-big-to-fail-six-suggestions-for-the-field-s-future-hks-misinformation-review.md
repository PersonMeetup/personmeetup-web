On my attempt to look for the headlines [Jreg](https://www.youtube.com/@jREG) flashed on the screen at the start of ["Disinfo On The Rise!"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=veD9VUzL_TM), I found this article which paints the referenced field of research in a more interesting light.

> We do not want to suggest that the present state of the field is dismal. It isn’t. But to simply dismiss the critiques lobbied against it out of hand would not be responsible either.

As a sidenote, I'm now thinking that if somebody flashes a headline in a video, you need to ask for the URL.
