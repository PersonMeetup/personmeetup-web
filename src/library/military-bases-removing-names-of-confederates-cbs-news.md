While the report focuses primarily on U.S. Army stripping Confederate generals names from bases, I felt like much of the same perspectives can be applied to the removal of other colonial monuments throughout the world. If nothing else, the opening line puts the issue succinctly.

> "What was gauling was that we would still, in this day and age, have names of bases that represented traitors who fought against their country for the purpose of slavery."
