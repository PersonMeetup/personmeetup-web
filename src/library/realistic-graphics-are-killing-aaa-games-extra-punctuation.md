I got reminded of this after seeing an article from [KitGuru](https://www.kitguru.net/) on how the head of Xbox Game Studios claims that the length of development for AAA games [“aren't two or three years anymore.”](https://www.kitguru.net/gaming/mustafa-mahmoud/head-of-xbox-game-studios-claims-the-days-of-2-3-year-dev-cycles-is-over/)

> As rendering technology continues to advance, graphics in video games can be more realistic than ever. We have lighting systems that can in real time create perfect reproductions of any physical environment at any time of day. A CG sequence of a celebrity performance can, to the casual glance, be indistinguishable from one being filmed in real life, although it might give you the creeps. Triple A video games are displaying unprecedented levels of visual fidelity. And it is fucking killing them.
