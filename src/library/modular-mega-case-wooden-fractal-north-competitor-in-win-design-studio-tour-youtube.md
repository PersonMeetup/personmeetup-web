In their recent coverage of Computex 2023, [Gamers Nexus](https://www.youtube.com/@GamersNexus) got a unique chance to cover In Win's design studio. While part of the video is dedicated to the products being showcased at the time, it also highlights the efforts from the designers and artists behind the cases.

> Everyone reports on new computer parts as they're announced, but the minute we walked past In Win's inspirational design centre on our way to the confrence room to cover the new products, we completely derailed the meeting and knew we had to shift the focus of our story to the people concepting, hand building, and prototyping the products right next door and cover their environment instead.
