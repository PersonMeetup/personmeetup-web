I could say that this site doesn't collect any user data (**which it doesn't, at all**), but we both know it's more complicated than that. If the **extrernally hosted services** you're using aren't GDPR compliant, neither are you. For the services this site does use, the general rule of thumb I've taken has been "**prioritize user privacy within reason**." That means if there's an approach to protect a users privacy while still providing the desired content, I'll take it.

The following is a list of services used, how they're mitigated if possible, and their respective privacy policies. Keep in mind that *Google Fonts* has not been included in the list because [directly linking to its API has been avoided](https://google-webfonts-helper.herokuapp.com/fonts).
