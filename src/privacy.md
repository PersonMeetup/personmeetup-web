I could say that this site doesn't collect any user data (**which it doesn't, at all**), but we both know it's more complicated than that. If the extrernally hosted services you're using aren't GDPR compliant, _neither are you_. For the services this site does use, the general rule of thumb I've taken has been "**prioritize user privacy within reason**." That means if there's an approach to protect a users privacy while still providing the desired content, I'll take it.

The following is a list of services used, how they're mitigated if possible, and their respective privacy policies. Keep in mind that while this site does use some fonts from the _Google Fonts_ library, that service's privacy policy is not included because [directly linking to its API has been avoided](https://gwfh.mranftl.com/fonts).
