  <h1>About</h1>
  <p class="description text-center">"Who is this Person anyway?"</p>
  <section class="bio">
    <p>Leslie “Person Meetup” Swan is a Canadian artist with a broad understanding of digital production. Cocreator of <em>COVALRIA</em>, he works as a writer and web designer for the comic. He is also secondary lead for <em>Portal: Catalyst</em>, with his focus primarily on writing and environment art. In his free time, Leslie continues to teach himself new skills through personal projects. His enjoyment of learning is rivaled only to the pleasure of creating art that makes others smile.</p>
    <p>Growing up in rural Alberta, Leslie would keep himself busy by studying a wide variety of skill sets. One day he could be experimenting with key frames, chroma keying, and visual effects in a video editor, the next he was creating custom levels for <em>Portal 2</em> using the engine's <em>Hammer World Editor</em>. When his interests expanded to learning music production, Leslie would familiarize himself with basic music theory as he played around with digital audio workstations such as <em>Ableton Live</em> and <em>LMMS</em>. </p>
		<p>Attentive to the detail of his work, Leslie often kept to himself, unless it was to ask for feedback on his work. For his parents, that led to being frequently surprised whenever they saw him perform. Whether it is playing two characters in his first high school drama performance or conducting a piece during a band concert, it was hard to expect what their son had been keeping from them this time.</p>
		<p>While adamant about the values of self-teaching, Leslie would enroll to the University of Lethbridge with the intent to study game design. Life had other plans, however, as he received a significantly more broad, sweeping education that emphasized how multiple fields intersected with one another. It gave him the chance to study fields of interest more deeply, as well as be introduced to ones he never would have considered. Now a Bachelor of Fine Arts in New Media with distinction, Leslie applies his breath of expertise to develop media for others to enjoy. </p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>"When it comes to my work, I'm often inspired by those around me. Whether I'm making something for someone or with
        others, I'm always aiming for what I make to get a positive reaction. I believe the most important aspect to any project
        I work on is that it needs to come from a genuine place of enjoyment rather than one of obligation. If it’s genuine, I
        won’t be afraid to experiment and contribute beyond what was initially expected of me. Even if I might not have the
        skillset required, I’ll still take a shot at any problems that might’ve occurred as it gives me a chance to grow my
        skills. I believe that my best work comes from projects that challenge me creatively, technically, and emotionally."</p>
