  <h1>About</h1>
  <p class="description text-center">"Who is this Person anyway?"</p>
  <section class="bio">
    <p>Leslie "Person Meetup" Swan is a multidisciplinary Canadian designer with a focus in New-Media. He is a self-taught
      Game Designer, Programmer, Music Producer and Video Editor who continues to add more skills to his repertoire as his
      determined work ethic pushes him into new fields. His enjoyment of learning new skillsets is rivaled only to his
      enjoyment of creating works that make others smile.</p>
    <p>Ever since he was young, Leslie has been experimenting with different mediums. Growing up he would spend hours
      editing together videos of him and his friends. These videos would grow in complexity as he learned about keyframes,
      chroma keying, and visual effects through experimentation. Once he entered high school, Leslie would join the percussion
      section in his school's band class. Initially only interested in the drums, he would later come around to the pitched
      percussion and eventually push to play pieces on the piano as well. During this time, Leslie would teach himself how to
      use Source's Hammer World Editor to create custom levels for Portal 2. His work since 2017 would lead into both his
      university career and his time as a Level Designer on Catalyst, where he would take on the role of Secondary Writer
      later on.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>"When it comes to my work, I'm often inspired by those around me. Whether I'm making something for someone or with
        others, I'm always aiming for what I make to get a positive reaction. I believe the most important aspect to any project
        I work on is that it needs to come from a genuine place of enjoyment rather than one of obligation. If it’s genuine, I
        won’t be afraid to experiment and contribute beyond what was initially expected of me. Even if I might not have the
        skillset required, I’ll still take a shot at any problems that might’ve occurred as it gives me a chance to grow my
        skills. I believe that my best work comes from projects that challenge me creatively, technically, and emotionally."</p>
