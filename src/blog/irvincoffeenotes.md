# Irvin's assignment research

Imagine the scene; your relaxing after a long day of work when you get a call from one of your friends. You find out they have an assignment due tonight that they're just getting started on. Worst part is, you just watched a rabbit hole gateway video that morning that covers some of the assignment's material.

Being blunt; a while back one of my friends on Discord called saying they needed to submit a clickbait article on brewing coffee by midnight. Not wanting to see them fail I got to work with them, brainstorming ideas for the article. It also helps that just that morning I watched [Tom Scott's collab with James Hoffmann](), so I ended up in a mini rabbit hole of YouTube coffee content. Perfect.

## Get yourself some WHOLE BEANS!

Whole bean coffee will always take the cake, according to experts like [James Hoffmann](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9YnLFrM7Fs). Ground coffee only ever has 1 - 2 days where it's at its best once you open up the pouch. Grinding coffee, while taking more effort, offers better value when you grind your beans before you brew. Plus, coffee grinding itself can give the room the perfect atmosphere when waking up in the morning! 

## Buy Quality Coffee! (Extention)

Another thing you want to keep in mind is the date that the coffee was roasted, often referred to as the roast dates. This term might catch you off guard, which isn't too surprising. Coffee you get from the grocery store only ever has a best before date on it. The problem with this though is that best before dates can range from 12 to 24 months after their roast date! If you really want some quality grounds, you might want to look into buying some specialty coffee straight from the roasters!

- Roast dates tell you when the coffee was roasted
- Supermarkets don't want roast dates, they want best before dates (may be 12 - 24 months after roasting)
- Where you buy will impact the information you're looking for
- Try buying from roasters directly, or rather from specialty sellers?

## Espresso: Fresher isn't always better

- When you roast coffee, CO2 is one of the byproducts and gets trapped in the coffee.
- Various brewing methods can bring the CO2 out
- Trying to brew fresh coffee beans as espresso can disrupt the brewing process
- People can rest the coffee from 1 to 2 weeks, or even longer to make espresso brewing easier.
- Filter coffee doesn't need to be rested for brewing.

## Get The Grounds Uniform!

Ideally when you grind your own coffee, you want the pieces to be the same size. Thinking about it like cooking vegetables of different sizes, smaller pieces will cook quicker than the larger ones. Applying this to coffee, the mix of the smaller chunks with bigger ones would get you a mixture of sourness and bitterness. It would be waking up on the wrong side of the bed in liquid form!
